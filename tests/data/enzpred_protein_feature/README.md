## About files under enzpred_protein_feature/

These embeddings were generated with using `tape-proteins` and `fair-esm` to make sure the embedding are almost identical with the embeddings from the project:
https://github.com/samgoldman97/enz-pred/blob/main/environment.yml

These embeddings were generated on Intel Mac. Also, `tape-proteins==0.5` was used instead of `tape-proteins==0.4`.
